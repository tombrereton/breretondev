## What is an aggregate object

What is an aggregate object? It's essentially using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with the concept of a root object that contains other objects.
In other words, if you model your domain using plain old csharp objects (POCOs) and relate them to each other in a tree structure, this would be an Aggregate
and the root of the tree would be the Aggregate Root. Another key point is that an aggregate ensures the business rules are true when modifying data.

For example, if you add a product to an order aggregate object we can check if it's already added and handle it accordingly. To elaborate further, if our requirement
was to not allow any duplicate products, the Order Aggregate would look like something below.

```csharp
public class OrderAggregate
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public List<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public decimal Total { get; set; }

    public void AddProduct(Product product)
    {
        if (Products.Contains(product))
        {
            throw new Exception("Product already added");
        }

        Products.Add(product);
        Total += product.Price;
    }
}
```

## When to use Aggregates

Here a few scenarios where you might want to use Aggregates:

- To centralise validation of business rules on entities
- When domain logic is not trivial and requires business rules to be true
- When updating data that has constraints or business rules that must be true

## Persistence

When peristing Aggregates we have to be careful the business rules don't become corrupted.
Therefore we want to load the entire Aggregate into memory, make the changes, and then save it back to the datastore.
This will ensure the business rules are always true as the Aggregate itself, has the validation logic i.e. business rules.

A way to do this is to use the Repository Pattern. However, instead of using a Repository per table, we use a Repository per Aggregate.
If you use the normal way and create a Repository per table in the datastore, then you will risk conflicting with the invariant rules of the Aggregate.
This is because it allows tables to be edited independently, which will likely lead corrupting the business rules.

An interesting side note is the use of [Owned Entities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/owned-entities) in EF Core,
which allow EF core to implement something similar to the aggregate pattern.

A performance benefit to the aggregate pattern is changes are made in memory and it is saved to the datastore as a bulk operation.
However if there is a lot of data transfered between the application and the datastore, then this should be monitored and optimised if necessary.

For referance, here is an example of a _simple_ Repository for the Order Aggregate.

```csharp
public interface OrderRepository
{
    void Add(OrderAggregate item);
    OrderAggregate Find(Predicate<T> match);
    void Remove(OrderAggregate item);
    void SaveChanges();
}

```

## Concurrency

Concurrency can be tricky. If we update the Aggregate in 2 separate threads at the same time make break the business rules (i.e. the invariants).
To prevent this we can use [Optimistic Concurrency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/concurrency?tabs=data-annotations) by the way of
versioning the data in the datastore. Now the application can check against the version to see if any changes were made in the meantime.

There is another option called Pessimistic Concurrency but this locks the data when changes are being made therefore essentially removing concurrency.
Additionally, it can lead to deadlocks.

## Testing

One question you might ask is if Aggregates need to implement an interface. The answer is no because an Aggregate is an encapulation of
domain logic and there is only one implementation of it's behaviour. Therefore using an interface is unnecessary abstraction.
You wouldn't have multiple implementation against that interface or swap it out for something new in the future.
The Aggregate contains the business rules and the only time it changes is if the requirements are updated.

When it comes to testing, you test directly against the object, no need to think about stubbing or mocking it.
To make things easier I recommend creating a test helper such as a fluent `Builder` class to make a "default" Aggregate.
Note this `Builder` class should only live in the Test project unless it make sense to have a default value in the application code.

## Commands vs Queries

Aggregates works really well with CQRS but you should only use aggregates on the command side. 
It's not necessary to worry about the business invariants when querying data as nothing is modified. 
Additionally you may want to get the data in a slight different shape, order, or filtered. 
Doing any of these operations on the aggregate is tedious and not really efficient as sorting and filtering 
has been moved in memory rather than taking advantage of the database power.

So for queries just stick with simplicity. If it's a SQL database, I suggest something like Dappper and use raw SQL. 
In .NET 7, linq may also be a good option as there have been some performance improvements.

For commands, we use the aggregates as normal as we are modifying data and therefore need to check the business invariants are still true.

## Developing with Aggregates

My preferred approach as a solo developer:

- Start with a usecase (feature)
- Use ATDD to build out feature
- During the refactoring process, look for opportunities to introduce an Aggregate

My preferred approach when working in a team:

- As a team activity, model the business process with Event Storming
- From Event Storming identity the use cases, entities, and aggregates
- Build stories which are split by use cases and take care around working on the same aggregate
